      Hey there! I'm Umer Khan, a first-year AI student with a passion for
      coding in C++, C and HTML/CSS. I'm absolutely fascinated by Linux and free
      software, and I love using them alongside Windows whenever possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a hands-on learner who believes the best way to understand something
      is to build it. Whether I'm crafting a command-line app, creating a useful
      tool or troubleshooting something that decided to break, I genuinely enjoy
      the puzzle-solving aspect of making things work.
    </p>

    <p>
      What really excites me? Bioinformatics, animal welfare and finding ways to
      use technology for positive change. I'm a cat person who believes in
      writing clean, readable code and loves collaborating on projects that
      actually make a difference.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to grow as a developer and eventually give back to the open
      source community that has taught me so much. I want to help others
      discover just how amazing free software can be.
    </p>

    <p>
      While I'm naturally more introverted, I absolutely love connecting with
      fellow developers and creators who share similar passions. When I'm not
      buried in code, you'll likely find me rocking out to my favorite music,
      sipping chai or getting lost in sci-fi and superhero movies (Batman will
      always be my favorite!).
    </p>

    <p>
      Got an interesting project in mind or just want to have a friendly chat
      about tech, cats or the latest Batman movie? I'd love to hear from you!
