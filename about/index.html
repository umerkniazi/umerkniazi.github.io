      Hi, I’m Umer Khan. I’m a first-year AI student who loves working with C++,
      C and HTML/CSS. I’m a big fan of Linux and free software and I use them
      whenever I can alongside Windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      I learn best by doing. Whether I’m writing a command-line app, building a
      small tool or fixing something that broke, I enjoy figuring things out and
      making them work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m curious about bioinformatics, animal welfare and using technology for
      good. I like cats, care about clean and readable code and enjoy teaming up
      on projects that have a purpose.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I learn more, I hope to give back to the open source community and help
      others discover the power of free software.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m an introvert but I’m always open to working with like-minded people
      who share my interests. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me
      listening to rock music, drinking chai or watching sci-fi and superhero
      movies, especially anything with Batman.
