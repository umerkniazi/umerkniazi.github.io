          <h3>Hospital Patient Management System</h3>
          <p>
            HPMS is a console-based Hospital Patient Management System written
            in C++. With HPMS, you can easily register, search, update and
            delete patient records. You can also organize records by symptoms
            and diagnoses. The program saves all data in a simple text file, so
            your changes are always there when you come back. I built this as a
            first-semester group project, and it was a great way to learn about
            file handling and working with structured data in C++.
