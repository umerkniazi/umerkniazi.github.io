          <h3>Hospital Patient Management System</h3>
          <p>
            Meet HPMS, my first major coding project! This console-based system
            was built with C++ during my first semester. It manages patient
            records, allowing users to register new patients, search existing
            records and organize information by symptoms and diagnoses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me the fundamentals of software development
            including file handling, data structures and team collaboration. It
            uses simple text files for data persistence, proving that elegant
            solutions don't need to be complex.

          <h3>Personal Website</h3>
          <p>
            This very site you're browsing! Built with Jekyll and hosted on
            GitHub Pages. I focused on creating a clean, minimal design that
            loads fast and puts content first.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site features responsive design, semantic HTML and CSS
            animations. It's been a great way to learn about static site
            generators and modern web development practices.
