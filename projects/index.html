          <p>
            Muse is a terminal-based music player for Windows and Linux inspired
            by

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >cmus</a
            >. It lets you play MP3 files from your music folder, navigate your
            library with keyboard controls and search for songs using fuzzy
            matching.
          </p>
          <p>
            The player supports shuffle and repeat modes and you can customize
            keybindings to suit your workflow. Your music folder setting is
            saved for convenience making it easy to jump back in where you left
            off. Installation is simple on both Windows and Linux and
            configuration is handled via a straightforward
            <code>config.json</code> file.

          <p>
            Meet HPMS, my first major coding project! This console-based system
            was built with C++ during my first semester. It manages patient
            records, allowing users to register new patients, search existing
            records and organize information by symptoms and diagnoses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me the fundamentals of software development
            including file handling, data structures and team collaboration. It
            uses simple text files for data persistence, proving that elegant
            solutions don't need to be complex.

          <p>
            This very site you're browsing! Built with Jekyll and hosted on
            GitHub Pages. I focused on creating a clean, minimal design that
            loads fast and puts content first.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site features responsive design, semantic HTML and CSS
            animations. It's been a great way to learn about static site
            generators and modern web development practices.
