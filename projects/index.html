          <h3>Hospital Patient Management System</h3>
          <p>
            Meet HPMS, my first major coding project! This console-based system
            was built with C++ during my first semester. It manages patient
            records, allowing users to register new patients, search existing
            records and organize information by symptoms and diagnoses.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project taught me the fundamentals of software development
            including file handling, data structures and team collaboration. It
            uses simple text files for data persistence, proving that elegant
            solutions don't need to be complex.
