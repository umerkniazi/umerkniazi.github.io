Hey there! This is my first post on the site, just making sure everything works as expected.

## What's Coming

I'm planning to write about:

- Things I'm learning in AI and development
- Projects I'm building
- Linux adventures and FOSS discoveries
- Thoughts on code, curiosity and problem-solving

**More posts coming soon.** Thanks for stopping by!
